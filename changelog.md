- Replaced the animated icon and gradient in the Hero Visual section of `Hero.tsx` with a visually appealing image placeholder (SVG in a rounded, shadowed container).
- Kept the floating feature pills ("AI Powered", "Real-time", "Social") for visual interest.
- Added a comment to indicate where to replace the placeholder with a real image in the future.
- Removed the unused `Activity` import to resolve lint errors.
